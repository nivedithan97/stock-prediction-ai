# Stock Prediction Analysis with GenAI, NLP & Chatbot

An interactive Streamlit dashboard that analyzes stocks (user-selected or market movers), shows intraday highs/lows, surfaces related news, and applies NLP + Generative AI to explain price moves. The project will later add a multimodal deep learning model (price + news) to predict whether the stock will go up or down the next day.

## Features
- Fetch historical stock prices (yfinance).  
- Fetch relevant news (yahoo_fin).  
- Compute intraday / daily highs and lows and show timestamps.  
- Filter news that occurred near price extremes.  
- Generate human-friendly insight summaries using Generative AI (OpenAI or other).  
- Chatbot interface for interactive Q&A.  
- Streamlit dashboard for UX and visualization.  
- Multimodal deep learning model combining price time-series + news embeddings.
